# Introduction
All the communications between LXD and its clients happen using a
RESTful API over http which is then encapsulated over either SSL for
remote operations or a unix socket for local operations.

Not all of the REST interface requires authentication:

 * GET to / is allowed for everyone (lists the API endpoints)
 * GET to /1.0 is allowed for everyone (but result varies)
 * POST to /1.0/certificates is allowed for everyone with a client certificate
 * GET to /1.0/images/\* is allowed for everyone but only returns public images for unauthenticated users

Unauthenticated endpoints are clearly identified as such below.

# API versioning
The list of supported major API versions can be retrieved using GET /.

The reason for a major API bump is if the API breaks backward compatibility.

Feature additions done without breaking backward compatibility only
result in a bump of the compat version which can be used by the client
to check if a given feature is supported by the server.

# Return values
There are three standard return types:
 * Standard return value
 * Background operation
 * Error

### Standard return value
For a standard synchronous operation, the following dict is returned:

    {
        'type': "sync",
        'status': "Success",
        'status_code': 200,
        'metadata': {}                          # Extra resource/action specific metadata
    }

HTTP code must be 200.

### Background operation
When a request results in a background operation, the HTTP code is set to 202 (Accepted)
and the Location HTTP header is set to the operation URL.

The body is a dict with the following structure:

    {
        'type': "async",
        'status': "OK",
        'status_code': 100,
        'operation': "/1.0/containers/<id>",                    # URL to the background operation
        'resources': {
            'containers': ["/1.0/containers/my-container"]      # List of affected resources
        },
        'metadata': {}                                          # Metadata relevant to the operation
    }

The body is mostly provided as a user friendly way of seeing what's
going on without having to pull the target operation, all information in
the body can also be retrieved from the background operation URL.

### Error
There are various situations in which something may immediately go
wrong, in those cases, the following return value is used:

    {
        'type': "error",
        'status': "Failure",
        'status_code': 400,
        'metadata': {}                      # More details about the error
    }

HTTP code must be one of of 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 412 or 500.

# Status codes
The LXD REST API often has to return status information, be that the
reason for an error, the current state of an operation or the state of
the various resources it exports.

To make it simple to debug, all of those are always doubled. There is a
numeric representation of the state which is guaranteed never to change
and can be relied on by API clients. Then there is a text version meant
to make it easier for people manually using the API to figure out what's
happening.

In most cases, those will be called status and status\_code, the former
being the user-friendly string representation and the latter the fixed
numeric value.

The codes are always 3 digits, with the following ranges:
 * 100 to 199: resource state (started, stopped, ready, ...)
 * 200 to 399: positive action result
 * 400 to 599: negative action result
 * 600 to 999: future use

## List of current status codes

Code  | Meaning
:---  | :------
100   | OK
101   | Started
102   | Stopped
103   | Running
104   | Cancelling
105   | Pending
200   | Success
400   | Failure
401   | Cancelled


# Safety for concurrent updates
The API uses the HTTP ETAG to prevent potential problems when a resource
changes on the server between the time it was accessed by the client and
the time it is sent back for update.

All GET queries come with an Etag HTTP header which is a short hash of
the content that is relevant for an update. Any information which is
read-only, shouldn't be included in the hash.

On update (PUT), the same Etag field can be set by the client in its
request alongside a If-Match header.. If it's set, the server will
then compute the current Etag for the resource and compare the two.
The update will then only be done if the two match.
If they don't, an error will be returned instead using HTTP error code
412 (Precondition failed).

For consistency in LXD's use of hashes, the Etag hash should be a SHA-256.

# Recursion
To optimize queries of large lists, recursion is implemented for collections.
A "recursion" argument can be passed to a GET query against a collection.

The default value is 0 which means that collection member URLs are
returned. Setting it to 1 will have those URLs be replaced by the object
they point to (typically a dict).

### PUT
 * Description: update container configuration or restore snapshot
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: async
 * Return: background operation or standard error

Input (update container configuration):

Takes the same structure as that returned by GET but doesn't allow name
changes (see POST below) or changes to the status sub-dict (since that's
read-only).

Input (restore snapshot):

    {
        'restore': "snapshot-name"
    }

### POST
 * Description: used to rename/migrate the container
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: async

## /1.0/containers/\<name\>/exec
### POST
 * Description: run a remote command
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: async
 * Return: background operation + optional websocket information or standard error

Input (run bash):

    {
        'command': ["/bin/bash"],       # Command and arguments
        'environment': {},              # Optional extra environment variables to set
        'wait-for-websocket': false,    # Whether to wait for a connection before starting the process
        'interactive': true             # Whether to allocate a pts device instead of PIPEs
    }

`wait-for-websocket` indicates whether the operation should block and wait for
a websocket connection to start (so that users can pass stdin and read
stdout), or simply run to completion with /dev/null as stdin and stdout.

When the exec command finishes, its exit status is available from the
operation's metadata:

    {
        'return': 0
    }

If interactive is set to true, a single websocket is returned and is mapped to a
pts device for stdin, stdout and stderr of the execed process.

If interactive is set to false (default), three pipes will be setup, one
for each of stdin, stdout and stderr.

Depending on the state of the interactive flag, one or three different
websocket/secret pairs will be returned, which are valid for connecting to this
operations /websocket endpoint.

Response metadata (interactive=true); the output of the pty is mirrored over
this websocket:

    {
        "-1": "secret"
    }

Response metadata (interactive=false); each of the process' fds are hooked up
to these (i.e. you can only write to 0, and read from 1 and 2):

    {
        "0": "secret0",
        "1": "secret1",
        "2": "secret2",
    }


## /1.0/events
This URL isn't a real REST API endpoint, instead doing a GET query on it
will upgrade the connection to a websocket on which notifications will
be sent.

### GET
 * Description: websocket upgrade
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: sync
 * Return: none (never ending flow of events)

Supported arguments are:
 * type: comma separated list of notifications to subscribe to (defaults to all)

The notification types are:
 * operations
 * logging

This never returns. Each notification is sent as a separate JSON dict:

    {
        'timestamp': 1415639996,                # Current timestamp
        'type': "operations",                   # Notification type
        'resource': "/1.0/operations/<uuid>",   # Resource URL
        'metadata': {}                          # Extra resource or type specific metadata
    }

    {
        'timestamp': 1415639996,
        'type': "logging",
        'resource': "/1.0",
        'metadata' {'message': "Service started"}
    }


## /1.0/images
### GET (?key=value&key1=value1...)

query URL.

### POST
 * Description: create and publish a new image
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: async
 * Return: background operation or standard error

Input (one of):
 * Standard http file upload
 * Soure container dictionary

In the http file upload case, The following headers may be set by the client:
 * X-LXD-fingerprint: SHA-256 (if set, uploaded file must match)
 * X-LXD-filename: FILENAME (used for export)
 * X-LXD-public: true/false (defaults to false)
 * X-LXD-properties: URL-encoded key value pairs without duplicate keys (optional properties)

In the source container case, the following dict must be passed:

    {
        "public": true,             # True or False
        "source": {
            "type": "container",    # One of "container" or "snapshot"
            "name": "abc"
        },
        "properties": {             # Image properties
            "os": "Ubuntu",
        }
    }


After the input is received by LXD, a background operation is started
which will add the image to the store and possibly do some backend
filesystem-specific optimizations.

## /1.0/images/\<fingerprint\>/export
### GET (optional secret=SECRET)
 * Description: Download the image tarball
 * Authentication: guest or trusted
 * Operation: sync
 * Return: Raw file or standard error

The secret string is required when an untrusted LXD is spawning a new
container from a private image stored on a different LXD.

Rather than require a trust relationship between the two LXDs, the
client will POST to /1.0/images/\<fingerprint\>/export to get a secret
token which it'll then pass to the target LXD. That target LXD will then
GET the image as a guest, passing the secret token.

### POST
 * Description: Generate a random token and tell LXD to expect it be used by a guest
 * Authentication: guest or trusted
 * Operation: async
 * Return: background operation or standard error

# Async operations
Any operation which may take more than a second to be done must be done
in the background, returning a background operation ID to the client.

The client will then be able to either poll for a status update or wait
for a notification using the long-poll API.

# Notifications
A long-poll API is available for notifications, different notification
types exist to limit the traffic going to the client.

It's recommend that the client always subscribes to the operations
notification type before triggering remote operations so that it doesn't
have to then poll for their status.
