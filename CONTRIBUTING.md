# Developer Certificate of Origin:

To improve tracking of contributions to this project we use the DCO 1.1
and use a "sign-off" procedure for all changes going into the branch.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
commit which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right
to pass it on as an open-source contribution.

An example of a valid sign-off line is:

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.org>

Use your real name and a valid e-mail address.
Sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions are allowed.

We also require each commit be individually signed-off by their author,
even when part of a larger set. You may find `git commit -s` useful.
