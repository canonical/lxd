# `lxd-generate`

## Introduction

`lxd-generate` is a database statement and associated `go` function generator
for LXD and related projects. `lxd-generate` utilizes `go`'s code generation
directives (`//go:generate ...`) alongside go's [ast](https://pkg.go.dev/go/ast)
package for parsing the syntax tree for go structs and variables. We use
`lxd-generate` for the majority of our SQL statements and database interactions
on the `go` side for consistency and predictability.

## Usage

### Initialization

Generally the first thing we will want to do for any newly generated file is to
establish the command, the target file, and ensure the file has been cleared of
content:

```go
//go:generate -command mapper lxd-generate db mapper -t instances.mapper.go
//go:generate mapper reset -i -b "//go:build linux && cgo && !agent"

```

This will initiate a call to `lxd-generate db mapper -t instances.mapper.go` on
each call to the go generation directive `mapper`.

### Generation Directive Arguments

* `//go:generate mapper stmt -e instance objects table=table_name`

The `table` key can be used to override the generated table name for a specified one.

* `//go:generate mapper method -e instance Create references=Config,Device`

For some tables (defined below under [Additional Information](#additional-information) as [EntityTable](#entitytable), the `references=<ReferenceEntity>` key can be provided with the name of
a [ReferenceTable](#referencetable) or [MapTable](#maptable) struct. This directive would produce `CreateInstance` in addition to `CreateInstanceConfig` and `CreateInstanceDevices`

* //go:generate mapper method -i -e instance_profile Create struct=Instance
* //go:generate mapper method -i -e instance_profile Create struct=Profile

For some tables (defined below under [Additional Information](#additional-information) as [AssociationTable](#associationtable), `method` declarations must
include a `struct=<Entity>` to indicate the directionality of the function. An invocation can be called for each direction.
This would produce `CreateInstanceProfiles` and `CreateProfileInstances` respectively.

### SQL Statement Generation

SQL generation supports the following SQL statement types:

Type                                  | Description
:---                                  | :----
`objects`                             | Creates a basic SELECT statement of the form `SELECT <columns> FROM <table> ORDER BY <columns>`.
`objects-by-<FIELD>-and-<FIELD>...`   | Parses a pre-existing SELECT statement variable declaration of the form produced by`objects`, and appends a `WHERE` clause with the given fields located in the associated struct. Specifically looks for a variable declaration of the form 'var <entity>Objects = RegisterStmt(`SQL String`)'
`create`                              | Creates a basic INSERT statement of the form `INSERT INTO <table> VALUES`.
`create-or-replace`                   | Creates a basic INSERT statement of the form `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO <table> VALUES`.
`delete-by-<FIELD>-and-<FIELD>...`    | Creates a DELETE statement of the form `DELETE FROM <table> WHERE <constraint>` where the constraint is based on the given fields of the associated struct.
`id`                                  | Creates a basic SELECT statement that returns just the internal ID of the table.
`rename`                              | Creates an UPDATE statement that updates the primary key of a table: `UPDATE <table> SET <primary key> WHERE <primary key = ?>`.
`update`                              | Creates an UPDATE statement of the form `UPDATE <table> SET <all columns> WHERE <primary key = ?>`.

#### Examples

```go
//go:generate mapper stmt -e instance objects
//go:generate mapper stmt -e instance objects-by-Name-and-Project
//go:generate mapper stmt -e instance create
//go:generate mapper stmt -e instance update
//go:generate mapper stmt -e instance delete-by-Name-and-Project
```

#### Statement Related Go Tags

There are several tags that can be added to fields of a struct that will be parsed by the `ast` package.

Tag                         | Description
:--                         | :----
`sql=<table>.<column>`      | Supply an explicit table and column name to use for this struct field.
`coalesce=<value>`          | Generates a SQL coalesce function with the given value `coalesce(<column>, value)`.
`order=yes`                 | Override the default `ORDER BY` columns with all fields specifying this tag.
`join=<joinTable.column>`   | Applies a `JOIN` of the form `JOIN <joinTable> ON <table>.<joinTable_id> = <joinTable.id>`.
`leftjoin=<table.column>`   | Applies a `LEFT JOIN` of the same form as a `JOIN`.
`joinon=<table>.<column>`   | Overrides the default `JOIN ON` clause with the given table and column, replacing `<table>.<joinTable_id>` above.
`primary=yes`               | Assigns column associated with the field to be sufficient for returning a row from the table. Will default to `Name` if unspecified. Fields with this key will be included in the default 'ORDER BY' clause.
`omit=<Stmt Types>`         | Omits a given field from consideration for the comma separated list of statement types (`create`, `objects-by-Name`, `update`).
`ignore=yes`                | Outright ignore the struct field as though it does not exist.
`marshal=yes`               | Marshal/Unmarshal data into the field. The column must be a TEXT column and the type must implement both `query.Marshal` and `query.Unmarshal`. This works for entity tables only, and not for association or mapping tables.

### Go Function Generation

Go function generation supports the following types:

Type                                | Description
:---                                | :----
`GetMany`                           | Return a slice of structs for all rows in a table matching the filter.
`GetOne`                            | Return a single struct corresponding to a row with the given primary keys. Depends on `GetMany`.
`ID`                                | Return the ID column from the table corresponding to the given primary keys.
`Exists`                            | Returns whether there is an row in the table with the given primary keys. Depends on `ID.`
`Create`                            | Insert a row from the given struct into the table if not already present. Depends on `Exists`
`CreateOrReplace`                   | Insert a row from the given struct into the table, regardless of if an entry already exists.
`Rename`                            | Update the primary key for a table row.
`Update`                            | Update the columns at a given row, specified by primary key.
`DeleteOne`                         | Delete exactly one row from the table.
`DeleteMany`                        | Delete one or more rows from the table.

```go
//go:generate mapper method -i -e instance GetMany
//go:generate mapper method -i -e instance GetOne
//go:generate mapper method -i -e instance ID
//go:generate mapper method -i -e instance Exist
//go:generate mapper method -i -e instance Create
//go:generate mapper method -i -e instance Update
//go:generate mapper method -i -e instance DeleteOne-by-Project-and-Name
//go:generate mapper method -i -e instance DeleteMany-by-Name
```

### Additional Information

All structs should have an `ID` field, as well as an additional `Filter` struct prefixed with the original struct name.
This should include any fields that should be considered for filtering in `WHERE` clauses.
These fields should be pointers to facilitate omission and inclusion without setting default values.

Example:

```go
type Instance struct {
  ID int
  Name string
  Project string
}

type InstanceFilter struct {
  Name *string
  Project *string
}
```

`lxd-generate` will handle parsing of structs differently based on the composition of the struct in four different ways.

Non-`EntityType` structs will only support `GetMany`, `Create`, `Update`, and `Delete` functions.

### EntityTable

Most structs will get treated this way, and represent a normal table.

* If a table has an associated table for which a `ReferenceTable` or `MapTable` as defined below is applicable, functions specific to this entity can be generated by
including a comma separated list to `references=<OtherEntity>` in the code generation directive for `GetMany`, `Create`, or `Update` directives.

* The `Create` method directive for `EntityTable` will expect on the `ID` and `Exist` method directives to be present.

* All `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements that include a joined table will expect a `var <entity>ID = RegisterStmt('SQL String')` to exist for the joining table.

### ReferenceTable

A struct that contains a field named `ReferenceID` will be parsed this way.
`lxd-generate` will use this struct to generate more abstract SQL statements and functions of the form `<parent_table>_<this_table>`.

Real world invocation of these statements and functions should be done through an `EntityTable` `method` call with the tag `references=<ThisStruct>`. This `EntityTable` will replace the `<parent_table>` above.

Example:

```go
//go:generate mapper stmt -e device create
//go:generate mapper method -e device Create

type Device struct {
  ID int
  ReferenceID int
  Name string
  Type string
}

//...
//go:generate mapper method -e instance Create references=Device
// This will produce a function called `CreateInstanceDevices`.
```

### MapTable

This is a special type of `ReferenceTable` with fields named `Key` and `Value`.
On the SQL side, this is treated exactly like a `ReferenceTable`, but on the `go` side, the return values will be a map.

Example:

```go
//go:generate mapper stmt -e config create
//go:generate mapper method -e config Create

type Config struct {
  ID int
  ReferenceID int
  Key string
  Value string
}

//...
//go:generate mapper method -e instance Create references=Config
// This will produce a function called `CreateInstanceConfig`, which will return a `map[string]string`.
```

### AssociationTable

This is a special type of table that contains two fields of the form `<Entity>ID`, where `<Entity>` corresponds to two other structs present in the same package.
This will generate code for compound tables of the form `<entity1>_<entity2>` that are generally used to associate two tables together by their IDs.

`method` generation declarations for these statements should include a `struct=<Entity>` to indicate the directionality of the function.
An invocation can be called for each direction.

Example:

```go

//go:generate mapper method -i -e instance_profile Create struct=Instance
//go:generate mapper method -i -e instance_profile Create struct=Profile

type InstanceProfile struct {
  InstanceID int
  ProfileID int
}
```
