  # 1. sed:
  #     a. Check for lines that contain a single closing brace (plus whitespace).
  #     b. Move the pattern space window forward to the next line.
  #     c. Match lines that start with a word character. This allows for a closing brace on subsequent lines.
  #     d. Print the line number.
  # 2. xargs: Print the filename next to the line number of the matches (piped).
  # 3. If there were no matches, the file name without the line number is printed, use grep to filter it out.
  # 4. Replace the space with a colon to make a clickable link.
