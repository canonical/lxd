# LXD
LXD is a next generation system container and virtual machine manager.
It offers a unified user experience around full Linux systems running inside containers or virtual machines.

It's image based with pre-made images available for a [wide number of Linux distributions](https://images.linuxcontainers.org)
and is built around a very powerful, yet pretty simple, REST API.

To get a better idea of what LXD is and what it does, you can [try it online](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/try-it/)!
Then if you want to run it locally, take a look at our [getting started guide](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/).

## Installing LXD from packages
The LXD daemon only works on Linux but the client tool (`lxc`) is available on most platforms.

OS                  | Format                                            | Command
---                 | ---                                               | ---
Linux               | [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/lxd)                  | snap install lxd
Windows             | [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/lxc) | choco install lxc
MacOS               | [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lxc)  | brew install lxc

More instructions on installing LXD for a wide variety of Linux distributions and operating systems [can be found on our website](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/).

To [install LXD from source](doc/installing.md#installing-lxd-from-source), see [Installing LXD](doc/installing.md#installing-lxd-from-source) in the documentation.

## Security
LXD, similar to other container and VM managers provides a UNIX socket for local communication.

**WARNING**: Anyone with access to that socket can fully control LXD, which includes
the ability to attach host devices and filesystems, this should
therefore only be given to users who would be trusted with root access
to the host.

When listening on the network, the same API is available on a TLS socket
(HTTPS), specific access on the remote API can be restricted through
Canonical RBAC.

More details are [available here](security.md).
