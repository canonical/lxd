# LXD
LXD is a next generation system container manager.  
It offers a user experience similar to virtual machines but using Linux containers instead.

It's image based with pre-made images available for a [wide number of Linux distributions](https://images.linuxcontainers.org)  
and is built around a very powerful, yet pretty simple, REST API.

To get a better idea of what LXD is and what it does, you can [try it online](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/try-it/)!  
Then if you want to run it locally, take a look at our [getting started guide](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/).

## Installing LXD from packages
Instructions on installing LXD for a wide variety of Linux distributions and operating systems [can be found on our website](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/).

## Installing LXD from source
We recommend having the latest versions of liblxc (>= 2.0.0 required) and CRIU
(>= 1.7 recommended) available for LXD development. Additionally, LXD requires
Golang 1.6 or later to work. On ubuntu, you can get those with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install acl dnsmasq-base git golang liblxc1 lxc-dev libacl1-dev make pkg-config rsync squashfs-tools tar xz-utils
```

There are a few storage backends for LXD besides the default "directory" backend.
Installing these tools adds a bit to initramfs and may slow down your
host boot, but are needed if you'd like to use a particular backend:

```bash
sudo apt install lvm2 thin-provisioning-tools
sudo apt install btrfs-tools
```

To run the testsuite, you'll also need:

```bash
sudo apt install curl gettext jq sqlite3 uuid-runtime bzr
```


### Building the tools
LXD consists of two binaries, a client called `lxc` and a server called `lxd`.
These live in the source tree in the `lxc/` and `lxd/` dirs, respectively.
To get the code, set up your go environment:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/go
export GOPATH=~/go
```

And then download it as usual:

```bash
go get github.com/lxc/lxd
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lxc/lxd
make
```

...which will give you two binaries in `$GOPATH/bin`, `lxd` the daemon binary,
and `lxc` a command line client to that daemon.

### Machine Setup
You'll need sub{u,g}ids for root, so that LXD can create the unprivileged
containers:

```bash
echo "root:1000000:65536" | sudo tee -a /etc/subuid /etc/subgid
```

Now you can run the daemon (the `--group` sudo bit allows everyone in the sudo
group to talk to LXD; you can create your own group if you want):

```bash
sudo -E $GOPATH/bin/lxd --group sudo
```

## Getting started with LXD
Now that you have LXD running on your system you can read the [getting started guide](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/) or go through more examples and configurations in [our documentation](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/tree/master/doc).

## FAQ
#### How to enable LXD server for remote access?
By default LXD server is not accessible from the networks as it only listens
on a local unix socket. You can make LXD available from the network by specifying
additional addresses to listen to. This is done with the `core.https_address`
config variable.

To see the current server configuration, run:

```bash
lxc config show
```

To set the address to listen to, find out what addresses are available and use
the `config set` command on the server:

```bash
ip addr
lxc config set core.https_address 192.168.1.15
```

#### When I do a `lxc remote add` over https, it asks for a password?
By default, LXD has no password for security reasons, so you can't do a remote
add this way. In order to set a password, do:

```bash
lxc config set core.trust_password SECRET
```

on the host LXD is running on. This will set the remote password that you can
then use to do `lxc remote add`.

You can also access the server without setting a password by copying the client
certificate from `.config/lxc/client.crt` to the server and adding it with:

```bash
lxc config trust add client.crt
```

#### How do I configure LXD storage?
LXD supports btrfs, ceph, directory, lvm and zfs based storage.

First make sure you have the relevant tools for your filesystem of
choice installed on the machine (btrfs-progs, lvm2 or zfsutils-linux).

By default, LXD comes with no configured network or storage.
You can get a basic configuration done with:

```bash
    lxd init
```

`lxd init` supports both directory based storage and ZFS.
If you want something else, you'll need to use the `lxc storage` command:

```bash
lxc storage create default BACKEND [OPTIONS...]
lxc profile device add default root disk path=/ pool=default
```

BACKEND is one of `btrfs`, `ceph`, `dir`, `lvm` or `zfs`.

Unless specified otherwise, LXD will setup loop based storage with a sane default size.

For production environments, you should be using block backed storage
instead both for performance and reliability reasons.

#### How can I live migrate a container using LXD?
Live migration requires a tool installed on both hosts called
[CRIU](http://criu.org), which is available in Ubuntu via:

```bash
sudo apt-get install criu
```

Then, launch your container with the following,

```bash
lxc launch ubuntu $somename
sleep 5s # let the container get to an interesting state
lxc move host1:$somename host2:$somename
```

And with luck you'll have migrated the container :). Migration is still in
experimental stages and may not work for all workloads. Please report bugs on
lxc-devel, and we can escalate to CRIU lists as necessary.

#### Can I bind mount my home directory in a container?
Yes. The easiest way to do that is using a privileged container to avoid file ownership issues:

1.a) create a container.

```bash
lxc launch ubuntu privilegedContainerName -c security.privileged=true
```

1.b) or, if your container already exists.

```bash
lxc config set privilegedContainerName security.privileged true
```

2) then.

```bash
lxc config device add privilegedContainerName shareName disk source=/home/$USER path=/home/ubuntu
```

#### How can I run docker inside a LXD container?
In order to run Docker inside a LXD container the `security.nesting` property of the container should be set to `true`. 

```bash
lxc config set <container> security.nesting true
```

Note that LXD containers cannot load kernel modules, so depending on your
Docker configuration you may need to have the needed extra kernel modules
loaded by the host.

You can do so by setting a comma separate list of kernel modules that your container needs with:

```bash
lxc config set <container> linux.kernel_modules <modules>
```

We have also received some reports that creating a `/.dockerenv` file in your
container can help Docker ignore some errors it's getting due to running in a
nested environment.

## Hacking on LXD
### Directly using the REST API
The LXD REST API can be used locally via unauthenticated Unix socket or remotely via SSL encapsulated TCP.

#### Via Unix socket

```bash
curl --unix-socket /var/lib/lxd/unix.socket \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST \
    -d @hello-ubuntu.json \
    lxd/1.0/containers
```

#### Via TCP
TCP requires some additional configuration and is not enabled by default.

```bash
lxc config set core.https_address "[::]:8443"
```

```bash
curl -k -L \
    --cert ~/.config/lxc/client.crt \
    --key ~/.config/lxc/client.key \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST \
    -d @hello-ubuntu.json \
    "https://127.0.0.1:8443/1.0/containers"
```

#### JSON payload
The `hello-ubuntu.json` file referenced above could contain something like:

```json
{
    "name":"some-ubuntu",
    "ephemeral":true,
    "config":{
        "limits.cpu":"2"
    },
    "source": {
        "type":"image",
        "mode":"pull",
        "protocol":"simplestreams",
        "server":"https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases",
        "alias":"14.04"
    }
}
```
