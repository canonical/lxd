# Server configuration
The server configuration is a simple set of key and values.

The key/value configuration is namespaced with the following namespaces
currently supported:

 - `backups` (backups configuration)
 - `candid` (External user authentication through Candid)
 - `cluster` (cluster configuration)
 - `core` (core daemon configuration)
 - `images` (image configuration)
 - `maas` (MAAS integration)
 - `rbac` (Role Based Access Control through external Candid + Canonical RBAC)

Those keys can be set using the lxc tool with:

```bash
lxc config set <key> <value>
```

When operating as part of a cluster, the keys marked with a `global`
scope will immediately be applied to all the cluster members. Those keys
with a `local` scope must be set on a per member basis using the
`--target` option of the command line tool.

## Exposing LXD to the network
By default, LXD can only be used by local users through a UNIX socket.

To expose LXD to the network, you'll need to set `core.https_address`.
All remote clients can then connect to LXD and access any image which
was marked for public use.

Trusted clients can be manually added to the trust store on the server
with `lxc config trust add` or the `core.trust_password` key can be set
allowing for clients to self-enroll into the trust store at connection
time by providing the confgiured password.

More details about authentication can be found [here](security.md).

## External authentication
LXD when accessed over the network can be configured to use external
authentication through [Candid](https://github.com/canonical/candid).

Setting the `candid.*` configuration keys above to the values matching
your Candid deployment will allow users to authenticate through their
web browsers and then get trusted by LXD.

For those that have a Canonical RBAC server in front of their Candid
server, they can instead set the `rbac.*` configuration keys which are a
superset of the `candid.*` ones and allow for LXD to integrate with the
RBAC service.

When integrated with RBAC, individual users and groups can be granted
various level of access on a per-project basis. All of this is driven
externally through the RBAC service.

More details about authentication can be found [here](security.md).
