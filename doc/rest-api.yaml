        This is the REST API used by all LXD clients.
        Internal endpoints aren't included in this documentation.

        The LXD API is available over both a local unix+http and remote https API.
        Authentication for local users relies on group membership and access to the unix socket.
        For remote users, the default authentication method is TLS client.

                The returned operation metadata will vary based on what's requested.
                For rename or move within the same server, this is a simple background operation with progress data.
                For migration, in the push case, this will similarly be a background
                operation with progress data, for the pull case, it will be a websocket
                operation with a number of secrets to be passed to the target server.

                The returned operation metadata will contain either 2 or 4 websockets.
                In non-interactive mode, you'll get one websocket for each of stdin, stdout and stderr.
                In interactive mode, a single bi-directional websocket is used for stdin and stdout/stderr.

                An additional "control" socket is always added on top which can be used for out of band communication with LXD.
                This allows sending signals and window sizing information through.

                operation with progress data, for the pull case, it will be a websocket

                The returned operation metadata will vary based on what's requested.
                For rename or move within the same server, this is a simple background operation with progress data.
                For migration, in the push case, this will similarly be a background
                operation with progress data, for the pull case, it will be a websocket
                operation with a number of secrets to be passed to the target server.
