# Events

## Introduction

Events are messages about actions that have occurred over LXD. Using the API endpoint `/1.0/events` directly or via
`lxc monitor` will connect to a WebSocket through which logs and life-cycle messages will be streamed.

## Event types

LXD Currently supports three event types.

- `logging`: Shows all logging messages regardless of the server logging level.
- `operation`: Shows all ongoing operations from creation to completion (including updates to their state and progress metadata).
- `lifecycle`: Shows an audit trail for specific actions occurring over LXD.

## Event structure

### Example

```yaml
location: cluster_name
metadata:
  action: network-updated
  requestor:
    protocol: unix
    username: root
  source: /1.0/networks/lxdbr0
timestamp: "2021-03-14T00:00:00Z"
type: lifecycle
```

- `location`: The cluster member name (if clustered).
- `timestamp`: Time that the event occurred in RFC3339 format.
- `type`: The type of event this is (one of `logging`, `operation`, or `lifecycle`).
- `metadata`: Information about the specific event type.

### Logging event structure

- `message`: The log message.
- `level`: The log-level of the log.
- `context`: Additional information included in the event.

### Operation event structure

- `id`: The UUID of the operation.
- `class`: The type of operation (`task`, `token`, or `websocket`).
- `description`: A description of the operation.
- `created_at`: The operation's creation date.
- `updated_at`: The operation's date of last change.
- `status`: The current state of the operation.
- `status_code`: The operation status code.
- `resources`: Resources affected by this operation.
- `metadata`: Operation specific metadata.
- `may_cancel`: Whether the operation may be canceled.
- `err`: Error message of the operation.
- `location`: The cluster member name (if clustered).

### Life-cycle event structure

- `action`: The life-cycle action that occurred.
- `requestor`: Information about who is making the request (if applicable).
- `source`: Path to what is being acted upon.
- `context`: Additional information included in the event.
