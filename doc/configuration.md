# Introduction
Current LXD stores the following kind of configurations:
 - Server configuration (the LXD daemon itself)
 - Container configuration

The server configuration is a simple set of key and values.

The container configuration is a bit more complex as it uses both
key/value configuration and some more complex configuration structures
for devices, network interfaces and storage volumes.

# Server configuration
## Key/value configuration
The key/value configuration is namespaced with the following namespaces
currently supported:
 - core (core daemon configuration)
 - images (image configuration)
 - storage (storage configuration)

Key                             | Type      | Default   | API extension                     | Description

Those keys can be set using the lxc tool with:

    lxc config set <key> <value>


# Container configuration
## Properties
The following are direct container properties and can't be part of a profile:
 - name
 - architecture

Name is the container name and can only be changed by renaming the container.

## Key/value configuration
The key/value configuration is namespaced with the following namespaces
currently supported:
 - boot (boot related options, timing, dependencies, ...)
 - environment (environment variables)
 - limits (resource limits)
 - raw (raw container configuration overrides)
 - security (security policies)
 - user (storage for user properties, searchable)
 - volatile (used internally by LXD to store settings that are specific to a specific container instance)

The currently supported keys are:

The following volatile keys are currently internally used by LXD:

Key                         | Type      | Default       | Description
:--                         | :---      | :------       | :----------
volatile.\<name\>.hwaddr    | string    | -             | Network device MAC address (when no hwaddr property is set on the device itself)
volatile.\<name\>.name      | string    | -             | Network device name (when no name propery is set on the device itself)
volatile.apply\_template    | string    | -             | The name of a template hook which should be triggered upon next startup
volatile.base\_image        | string    | -             | The hash of the image the container was created from, if any.
volatile.last\_state.idmap  | string    | -             | Serialized container uid/gid map
volatile.last\_state.power  | string    | -             | Container state as of last host shutdown


Additionally, those user keys have become common with images (support isn't guaranteed):

Key                         | Type          | Default           | Description
:--                         | :---          | :------           | :----------
user.network\_mode          | string        | dhcp              | One of "dhcp" or "link-local". Used to configure network in supported images.
user.meta-data              | string        | -                 | Cloud-init meta-data, content is appended to seed value.
user.user-data              | string        | #!cloud-config    | Cloud-init user-data, content is used as seed value.
user.vendor-data            | string        | #!cloud-config    | Cloud-init vendor-data, content is used as seed value.

Note that while a type is defined above as a convenience, all values are
stored as strings and should be exported over the REST API as strings
(which makes it possible to support any extra values without breaking
backward compatibility).

Those keys can be set using the lxc tool with:

    lxc config set <container> <key> <value>

Volatile keys can't be set by the user and can only be set directly against a container.

The raw keys allow direct interaction with the backend features that LXD
itself uses, setting those may very well break LXD in non-obvious ways
and should whenever possible be avoided.


## Devices configuration
LXD will always provide the container with the basic devices which are
required for a standard POSIX system to work. These aren't visible in
container or profile configuration and may not be overriden.

Those includes:
 - /dev/null (character device)
 - /dev/zero (character device)
 - /dev/full (character device)
 - /dev/console (character device)
 - /dev/tty (character device)
 - /dev/random (character device)
 - /dev/urandom (character device)
 - /dev/net/tun (character device)
 - /dev/fuse (character device)
 - lo (network interface)

Anything else has to be defined in the container configuration or in one
of its profiles. The default profile will typically contain a network
interface to become eth0 in the container.

To add extra devices to a container, device entries can be added
directly to a container, or to a profile.

Devices may be added or removed while the container is running.

Every device entry is identified by a unique name. If the same name is
used in a subsequent profile or in the container's own configuration,
the whole entry is overriden by the new definition.

Device entries are added through:
    lxc config device add <container> <name> <type> [key=value]...
    lxc profile device add <profile> <name> <type> [key=value]...

### Device types
LXD supports the following device types:

ID (database)   | Name          | Description
:--             | :--           | :--
0               | none          | Inheritance blocker
1               | nic           | Network interface
2               | disk          | Mountpoint inside the container
3               | unix-char     | Unix character device
4               | unix-block    | Unix block device

### Type: none
A none type device doesn't have any property and doesn't create anything inside the container.

It's only purpose it to stop inheritance of devices coming from profiles.

To do so, just add a none type device with the same name of the one you wish to skip inheriting.
It can be added in a profile being applied after the profile it originated from or directly on the container.

### Type: nic
LXD supports different kind of network devices:
 - physical: Straight physical device passthrough from the host. The targeted device will vanish from the host and appear in the container.
 - bridged: Uses an existing bridge on the host and creates a virtual device pair to connect the host bridge to the container.
 - macvlan: Sets up a new network device based on an existing one but using a different MAC address.
 - p2p: Creates a virtual device pair, putting one side in the container and leaving the other side on the host.

Different network interface types have different additional properties, the current list is:

Key             | Type      | Default           | Required  | Used by                       | Description
:--             | :--       | :--               | :--       | :--                           | :--
nictype         | string    | -                 | yes       | all                           | The device type, one of "physical", "bridged", "macvlan" or "p2p"
limits.ingress  | string    | -                 | no        | bridged, p2p                  | I/O limit in bit/s (supports kbit, Mbit, Gbit suffixes)

limits.max      | string    | -                 | no        | bridged, p2p                  | Same as modifying both limits.read and limits.write
name            | string    | kernel assigned   | no        | all                           | The name of the interface inside the container
host\_name      | string    | randomly assigned | no        | bridged, p2p, macvlan         | The name of the interface inside the host
hwaddr          | string    | randomly assigned | no        | all                           | The MAC address of the new interface
mtu             | integer   | parent MTU        | no        | all                           | The MTU of the new interface
parent          | string    | -                 | yes       | physical, bridged, macvlan    | The name of the host device or bridge

### Type: disk
Disk entries are essentially mountpoints inside the container. They can
either be a bind-mount of an existing file or directory on the host, or
if the source is a block device, a regular mount.

The following properties exist:

Key             | Type      | Default           | Required  | Description
:--             | :--       | :--               | :--       | :--
limits.read     | string    | -                 | no        | I/O limit in byte/s (supports kB, MB, GB, TB, PB and EB suffixes) or in iops (must be suffixed with "iops")
limits.write    | string    | -                 | no        | I/O limit in byte/s (supports kB, MB, GB, TB, PB and EB suffixes) or in iops (must be suffixed with "iops")
limits.max      | string    | -                 | no        | Same as modifying both limits.read and limits.write
path            | string    | -                 | yes       | Path inside the container where the disk will be mounted
source          | string    | -                 | yes       | Path on the host, either to a file/directory or to a block device
optional        | boolean   | false             | no        | Controls whether to fail if the source doesn't exist
readonly        | boolean   | false             | no        | Controls whether to make the mount read-only
size            | string    | -                 | no        | Disk size in bytes (supports kB, MB, GB, TB, PB and EB suffixes). This is only supported for the rootfs (/).
recursive       | boolean   | false             | no        | Whether or not to recursively mount the source path

If multiple disks, backed by the same block device, have I/O limits set,
the average of the limits will be used.

### Type: unix-char
Unix character device entries simply make the requested character device
appear in the container's /dev and allow read/write operations to it.

The following properties exist:

Key         | Type      | Default           | Required  | Description
:--         | :--       | :--               | :--       | :--
path        | string    | -                 | yes       | Path inside the container
major       | int       | device on host    | no        | Device major number
minor       | int       | device on host    | no        | Device minor number
uid         | int       | 0                 | no        | UID of the device owner in the container
gid         | int       | 0                 | no        | GID of the device owner in the container
mode        | int       | 0660              | no        | Mode of the device in the container

### Type: unix-block
Unix block device entries simply make the requested block device
appear in the container's /dev and allow read/write operations to it.

The following properties exist:

Key         | Type      | Default           | Required  | Description
:--         | :--       | :--               | :--       | :--
path        | string    | -                 | yes       | Path inside the container
major       | int       | device on host    | no        | Device major number
minor       | int       | device on host    | no        | Device minor number
uid         | int       | 0                 | no        | UID of the device owner in the container
gid         | int       | 0                 | no        | GID of the device owner in the container
mode        | int       | 0660              | no        | Mode of the device in the container

### Type: usb
USB device entries simply make the requested USB device appear in the
container.

The following properties exist:

Key         | Type      | Default           | Required  | Description
:--         | :--       | :--               | :--       | :--
productid   | string    | -                 | yes       | The product id of the USB device.
vendorid    | string    | -                 | no        | The vendor id of the USB device.
uid         | int       | 0                 | no        | UID of the device owner in the container
gid         | int       | 0                 | no        | GID of the device owner in the container
mode        | int       | 0660              | no        | Mode of the device in the container
required    | boolean   | false             | no        | Whether or not this device is required to start the container. (The default is no, and all devices are hot-pluggable.)

## Profiles
Profiles can store any configuration that a container can (key/value or devices)
and any number of profiles can be applied to a container.

Profiles are applied in the order they are specified so the last profile
to specify a specific key wins.

In any case, resource-specific configuration always overrides that
coming from the profiles.


If not present, LXD will create a "default" profile which comes with a
network interface connected to LXD's default bridge (lxdbr0).

The "default" profile is set for any new container created which doesn't
specify a different profiles list.
