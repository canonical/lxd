# Network configuration

The key/value configuration is namespaced with the following namespaces
currently supported:

 - `bridge` (L2 interface configuration)
 - `fan` (configuration specific to the Ubuntu FAN overlay)
 - `tunnel` (cross-host tunneling configuration)
 - `ipv4` (L3 IPv4 configuration)
 - `ipv6` (L3 IPv6 configuration)
 - `dns` (DNS server and resolution configuration)
 - `raw` (raw configuration file content)
 - `user` (free form key/value for user metadata)

## Bridges

As one of the possible network configuration types under LXD,
LXD supports creating and managing network bridges. LXD bridges
can leverage underlying native Linux bridges and Open vSwitch.

Creation and management of LXD bridges is performed via the `lxc network`
command. A bridge created by LXD is by default "managed" which
means that LXD also will additionally set up a local `dnsmasq`
DHCP server and if desired also perform NAT for the bridge (this
is the default.)

When a bridge is managed by LXD, configuration values
under the `bridge` namespace can be used to configure it.

Additionally, LXD can utilize a pre-existing Linux
bridge. In this case, the bridge does not need to be created via
`lxc network` and can simply be referenced in an instance or
profile device configuration as follows:

```
devices:
  eth0:
     name: eth0
     nictype: bridged
     parent: br0
     type: nic
```

## Configuration Settings

A complete list of configuration settings for LXD networks can
be found below.

It is expected that IP addresses and subnets are given using CIDR
notation (`1.1.1.1/24` or `fd80:1234::1/64`). The exception being
tunnel local and remote addresses which are just plain addresses
(`1.1.1.1` or `fd80:1234::1`).

Those keys can be set using the lxc tool with:

```bash
lxc network set <network> <key> <value>
```

## Integration with systemd-resolved

If the system running LXD uses systemd-resolved to perform DNS
lookups, it's possible to notify resolved of the domain(s) that
LXD is able to resolve.  This requires telling resolved the
specific bridge(s), nameserver address(es), and dns domain(s).

For example, if LXD is using the `lxdbr0` interface, get the
ipv4 address with `lxc network get lxdbr0 ipv4.address` command
(the ipv6 can be used instead or in addition), and the domain
with `lxc network get lxdbr0 dns.domain` (if unset, the domain
is `lxd` as shown in the table above).  Then notify resolved:

```
systemd-resolve --interface lxdbr0 --set-domain '~lxd' --set-dns 1.2.3.4
```

Replace `lxdbr0` with the actual bridge name, and `1.2.3.4` with
the actual address of the nameserver (without the subnet netmask).

Also replace `lxd` with the domain name.  Note the `~` before the
domain name is important; it tells resolved to use this
nameserver to look up only this domain; no matter what your
actual domain name is, you should prefix it with `~`.  Also,
since the shell may expand the `~` character, you may need to
include it in quotes.

In newer releases of systemd, the `systemd-resolve` command has been
deprecated, however it is still provided for backwards compatibility
(as of this writing).  The newer method to notify resolved is using
the `resolvectl` command, which would be done in two steps:

```
resolvectl dns lxdbr0 1.2.3.4
resolvectl domain lxdbr0 '~lxd'
```

This resolved configuration will persist as long as the bridge
exists, so you must repeat this command each reboot and after
LXD is restarted.  Also note this only works if the bridge
`dns.mode` is not `none`.

## Allow DHCP, DNS with Firewalld

In order to allow instances to access the DHCP and DNS server that LXD runs on the host when using firewalld
you need to add the host's bridge interface to the `trusted` zone in firewalld.

To do this permanently (so that it persists after a reboot) run the following command:

```
firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=<LXD network name> --permanent
```

E.g. for a bridged network called `lxdbr0` run the command:

```
firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=lxdbr0 --permanent
```

This will then allow LXD's own firewall rules to take effect.


## How to let Firewalld control the LXD's iptables rules

When using firewalld and LXD together, iptables rules can overlaps. For example, firewalld could erase LXD iptables rules if it is started after LXD daemon, then LXD container will not be able to do any oubound internet access.
On way to fix it is to delegate to firewalld the LXD's iptables rules and to disable the LXD ones.

First step is to [allow DNS and DHCP](#allow-dhcp-dns-with-firewalld).

Then to tell to LXD totally stop to set iptables rules (because firewalld will do it):
```
lxc network set lxdbr0 ipv4.nat false
lxc network set lxdbr0 ipv6.nat false
lxc network set lxdbr0 ipv6.firewall false
lxc network set lxdbr0 ipv4.firewall false
```

Finally, to enable iptables firewalld's rules for LXD usecase (in this example, we suppose the bridge interface is `lxdbr0` and the associated IP range is `10.0.0.0/24`:
```
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 -i lxdbr0 -s 10.0.0.0/24 -m comment --comment "generated by firewalld for LXD" -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter OUTPUT 0 -o lxdbr0 -d 10.0.0.0/24 -m comment --comment "generated by firewalld for LXD" -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 0 -i lxdbr0 -s 10.0.0.0/24 -m comment --comment "generated by firewalld for LXD" -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 nat POSTROUTING 0 -s 10.0.0.0/24 ! -d 10.0.0.0/24 -m comment --comment "generated by firewalld for LXD" -j MASQUERADE
firewall-cmd --reload
```
To check the rules are taken into account by firewalld:
```
firewall-cmd --direct --get-all-rules 
```

Warning: what is exposed above is not a fool-proof approach and may end up inadvertently introducing a security risk.
