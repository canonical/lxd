# How to resize a storage pool

If you need more storage, you can increase the size of your storage pool.

To increase the size of a storage pool, follow these general steps:

1. Grow the size of the storage on disk.
1. Let the file system know of the size change.

See the specific commands for different storage drivers below.

````{tabs}

```{group-tab} Btrfs

Enter the following commands to grow a loop-backed Btrfs pool by 5 Gigabytes:

    sudo truncate -s +5G <LXD_lib_dir>/disks/<pool_name>.img
    sudo losetup -c <loop_device>
    sudo btrfs filesystem resize max <LXD_lib_dir>/storage-pools/<pool_name>/

Replace the following variables:

`<LXD_lib_dir>`
: `/var/snap/lxd/common/mntns/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/` if you are using the snap, or `/var/lib/lxd/` otherwise.

`<pool_name>`
: The name of your storage pool (for example, `my-pool`).

`<loop_device>`
: The mounted loop device that is associated with the storage pool image (for example, `/dev/loop8`).
  To find your loop device, enter `losetup -j <LXD_lib_dir>/disks/<pool_name>.img`.
  You can also use `losetup -l` to list all mounted loop devices.
```
```{group-tab} LVM

Enter the following commands to grow a loop-backed LVM pool by 5 Gigabytes:

    sudo truncate -s +5G <LXD_lib_dir>/disks/<pool_name>.img
    sudo losetup -c <loop_device>
    sudo pvresize <loop_device>

For LVM thin pools, you must then expand the `LXDThinPool` logical volume in your pool (skip this step if you are not using a thin pool):

    sudo lvextend <pool_name>/LXDThinPool -l+100%FREE

Replace the following variables:

`<LXD_lib_dir>`
: `/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/` if you are using the snap, or `/var/lib/lxd/` otherwise.

`<pool_name>`
: The name of your storage pool (for example, `my-pool`).

`<loop_device>`
: The mounted loop device that is associated with the storage pool image (for example, `/dev/loop8`).
  To find your loop device, enter `losetup -j <LXD_lib_dir>/disks/<pool_name>.img`.
  You can also use `losetup -l` to list all mounted loop devices.

You can check that the pool was resized as expected with the following commands:

    sudo pvs <loop_device> # Check the size of the physical volume
    sudo vgs <pool_name> # Check the size of the volume group
    sudo lvs <pool_name>/LXDThinPool # Thin pool only: check the size of the thin-pool logical volume
```
```{group-tab} ZFS

Enter the following commands to grow a loop-backed ZFS pool by 5 Gigabytes:

    sudo truncate -s +5G <LXD_lib_dir>/disks/<pool_name>.img
    sudo zpool set autoexpand=on <pool_name>
    sudo zpool online -e <pool_name> <device_ID>
    sudo zpool set autoexpand=off <pool_name>

Replace the following variables:

`<LXD_lib_dir>`
: `/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/` if you are using the snap, or `/var/lib/lxd/` otherwise.

`<pool_name>`
: The name of your storage pool (for example, `my-pool`).

`<device_ID>`
: The ID of the ZFS device.
  Enter `sudo zpool status -vg <pool_name>` to find the ID.
```
