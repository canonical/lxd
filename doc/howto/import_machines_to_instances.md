# How to import physical or virtual machines to LXD instances

```{youtube} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GALjHtnUU
```

If you have an existing machine, either physical or virtual (VM or container), you can use the `lxd-migrate` tool to create a LXD instance based on your existing disk or image.

The tool copies the provided partition, disk or image to the LXD storage pool of the provided LXD server, sets up an instance using that storage and allows you to configure additional settings for the new instance.

```{note}
If you want to configure your new instance during the migration process, set up the entities that you want your instance to use before starting the migration process.

By default, the new instance will use the entities specified in the `default` profile.
You can specify a different profile (or a profile list) to customize the configuration.
See {ref}`profiles` for more information.
You can also override {ref}`instance-options`, the {ref}`storage pool <storage-pools>` to be used and the size for the {ref}`storage volume <storage-volumes>`, and the {ref}`network <networking>` to be used.

Alternatively, you can update the instance configuration after the migration is complete.
```

The tool can create both containers and virtual machines:

* When creating a container, you must provide a disk or partition that contains the root file system for the container.
  For example, this could be the `/` root disk of the machine or container where you are running the tool.
* When creating a virtual machine, you must provide a bootable disk, partition, or an image in raw, QCOW, QCOW2, VDI, VHDX, or VMDK format.
  This means that just providing a file system is not sufficient, and you cannot create a virtual machine from a container that you are running.
  It is also not possible to create a virtual machine from the physical machine that you are using to do the migration, because the migration tool would be using the disk that it is copying.
  Instead, you could provide a bootable image, or a bootable partition or disk that is currently not in use.

   If you want to convert a Windows VM from a foreign hypervisor (not from QEMU/KVM with Q35/`virtio-scsi`),
   you must install the `virtio-win` drivers to your Windows. Otherwise, your VM won't boot.
   <details>
   <summary>Expand to see how to integrate the required drivers to your Windows VM</summary>
   Install the required tools on the host:

   1. Install `virt-v2v` version >= 2.3.4 (this is the minimal version that supports the `--block-driver` option).
   1. Install the `virtio-win` package, or download the [`virtio-win.iso`](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso) image and put it into the `/usr/share/virtio-win` folder.
   1. You might also need to install [`rhsrvany`](https://github.com/rwmjones/rhsrvany).

   Now you can use `virt-v2v` to convert images from a foreign hypervisor to `raw` images for LXD and include the required drivers:

   ```
   # Example 1. Convert a vmdk disk image to a raw image suitable for lxd-migrate
   sudo virt-v2v --block-driver virtio-scsi -o local -of raw -os ./os -i vmx ./test-vm.vmx
   # Example 2. Convert a QEMU/KVM qcow2 image and integrate virtio-scsi driver
   sudo virt-v2v --block-driver virtio-scsi -o local -of raw -os ./os -if qcow2 -i disk test-vm-disk.qcow2
   ```

   You can find the resulting image in the `os` directory and use it with `lxd-migrate` on the next steps.
   </details>
   ````

Complete the following steps to migrate an existing machine to a LXD instance:

1. Download the `bin.linux.lxd-migrate` tool ([`bin.linux.lxd-migrate.aarch64`](https://github.com/canonical/lxd/releases/latest/download/bin.linux.lxd-migrate.aarch64) or [`bin.linux.lxd-migrate.x86_64`](https://github.com/canonical/lxd/releases/latest/download/bin.linux.lxd-migrate.x86_64)) from the **Assets** section of the latest [LXD release](https://github.com/canonical/lxd/releases).
1. Place the tool on the machine that you want to use to create the instance.
   Make it executable (usually by running `chmod u+x bin.linux.lxd-migrate`).
1. Make sure that the machine has `rsync` installed.
   If it is missing, install it (for example, with `sudo apt install rsync`).
1. Run the tool:

       sudo ./bin.linux.lxd-migrate

   The tool then asks you to provide the information required for the migration.

   1. Specify the LXD server URL, either as an IP address or as a DNS name.

      ```{note}
      The LXD server must be {ref}`exposed to the network <server-expose>`.
      If you want to import to a local LXD server, you must still expose it to the network.
      You can then specify `127.0.0.1` as the IP address to access the local server.
      ```

   1. Check and confirm the certificate fingerprint.
   1. Choose a method for authentication (see {ref}`authentication`).

      For example, if you choose using a certificate token, log on to the LXD server and create a token for the machine on which you are running the migration tool with [`lxc config trust add`](lxc_config_trust_add.md).
      Then use the generated token to authenticate the tool.
   1. Choose whether to create a container or a virtual machine.
      See {ref}`containers-and-vms`.
   1. Specify a name for the instance that you are creating.
   1. Provide the path to a root file system (for containers) or a bootable disk, partition or image file (for virtual machines).
   1. For containers, optionally add additional file system mounts.
   1. For virtual machines, specify whether secure boot is supported.
   1. Optionally, configure the new instance.
      You can do so by specifying {ref}`profiles <profiles>`, directly setting {ref}`configuration options <instance-options>` or changing {ref}`storage <storage>` or {ref}`network <networking>` settings.

      Alternatively, you can configure the new instance after the migration.
   1. When you are done with the configuration, start the migration process.

1. When the migration is complete, check the new instance and update its configuration to the new environment.
   Typically, you must update at least the storage configuration (`/etc/fstab`) and the network configuration.
