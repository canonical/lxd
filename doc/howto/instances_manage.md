# How to manage instances

When listing the existing instances, you can see their type, status, and location (if applicable).
You can filter the instances and display only the ones that you are interested in.

````{tabs}
```{group-tab} CLI
Enter the following command to list all instances:

    lxc list

You can filter the instances that are displayed, for example, by type, status or the cluster member where the instance is located:

    lxc list type=container
    lxc list status=running
    lxc list location=server1

You can also filter by name.
To list several instances, use a regular expression for the name.
For example:

    lxc list ubuntu.*

Enter [`lxc list --help`](lxc_list.md) to see all filter options.
```

```{group-tab} API
Query the `/1.0/instances` endpoint to list all instances.
You can use {ref}`rest-api-recursion` to display more information about the instances:

    lxc query /1.0/instances?recursion=2

You can {ref}`filter <rest-api-filtering>` the instances that are displayed, by name, type, status or the cluster member where the instance is located:

    lxc query /1.0/instances?filter=name+eq+ubuntu
    lxc query /1.0/instances?filter=type+eq+container
    lxc query /1.0/instances?filter=status+eq+running
    lxc query /1.0/instances?filter=location+eq+server1

To list several instances, use a regular expression for the name.
For example:

    lxc query /1.0/instances?filter=name+eq+ubuntu.*

See [`GET /1.0/instances`](swagger:/instances/instances_get) for more information.
```
````

## Show information about an instance

````{tabs}
```{group-tab} CLI
Enter the following command to show detailed information about an instance:

    lxc info <instance_name>

Add `--show-log` to the command to show the latest log lines for the instance:

    lxc info <instance_name> --show-log
```

```{group-tab} API
Query the following endpoint to show detailed information about an instance:

    lxc query /1.0/instances/<instance_name>

See [`GET /1.0/instances/{name}`](swagger:/instances/instance_get) for more information.
```
````

## Start an instance

````{tabs}
```{group-tab} CLI
Enter the following command to start an instance:

    lxc start <instance_name>

You will get an error if the instance does not exist or if it is running already.

To immediately attach to the console when starting, pass the `--console` flag.
For example:

    lxc start <instance_name> --console

See {ref}`instances-console` for more information.
```

```{group-tab} API
To start an instance, send a PUT request to change the instance state:

    lxc query --request PUT /1.0/instances/<instance_name>/state --data '{"action":"start"}'

<!-- Include start monitor status -->
The return value of this query contains an operation ID, which you can use to query the status of the operation:

    lxc query /1.0/operations/<operation_ID>

Use the following query to monitor the state of the instance:

    lxc query /1.0/instances/<instance_name>/state

See [`GET /1.0/instances/{name}/state`](swagger:/instances/instance_state_get) and [`PUT /1.0/instances/{name}/state`](swagger:/instances/instance_state_put)for more information.
<!-- Include end monitor status -->
```
````

(instances-manage-stop)=
## Stop an instance

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} CLI
Enter the following command to stop an instance:

    lxc stop <instance_name>

You will get an error if the instance does not exist or if it is not running.
````

````{group-tab} API
To stop an instance, send a PUT request to change the instance state:

    lxc query --request PUT /1.0/instances/<instance_name>/state --data '{"action":"stop"}'

% Include content from above
```{include} ./instances_manage.md
    :start-after: <!-- Include start monitor status -->
    :end-before: <!-- Include end monitor status -->
```

````
`````

## Delete an instance

If you don't need an instance anymore, you can remove it.
The instance must be stopped before you can delete it.

````{tabs}
```{group-tab} CLI
Enter the following command to delete an instance:

    lxc delete <instance_name>
```

```{group-tab} API
To delete an instance, send a DELETE request to the instance:

    lxc query --request DELETE /1.0/instances/<instance_name>

See [`DELETE /1.0/instances/{name}`](swagger:/instances/instance_delete) for more information.
```
````

```{caution}
This command permanently deletes the instance and all its snapshots.
```

### Prevent accidental deletion of instances

There are different ways to prevent accidental deletion of instances:

- To protect a specific instance from being deleted, set {config:option}`instance-security:security.protection.delete` to `true` for the instance.
  See {ref}`instances-configure` for instructions.
- In the CLI client, you can create an alias to be prompted for approval every time you use the [`lxc delete`](lxc_delete.md) command:

       lxc alias add delete "delete -i"

## Rebuild an instance

If you want to wipe and re-initialize the root disk of your instance but keep the instance configuration, you can rebuild the instance.

Rebuilding is only possible for instances that do not have any snapshots.

Stop your instance before rebuilding it.

````{tabs}
```{group-tab} CLI
Enter the following command to rebuild the instance with a different image:

    lxc rebuild <image_name> <instance_name>

Enter the following command to rebuild the instance with an empty root disk:

    lxc rebuild <instance_name> --empty

For more information about the `rebuild` command, see [`lxc rebuild --help`](lxc_rebuild.md).
```

```{group-tab} API
To rebuild the instance with a different image, send a POST request to the instance's `rebuild` endpoint.
For example:

    lxc query --request POST /1.0/instances/<instance_name>/rebuild --data '{"source": {"alias":"<image_alias>","server":"<server_URL>", protocol:"simplestreams"}}'

To rebuild the instance with an empty root disk, specify the source type as `none`:

    lxc query --request POST /1.0/instances/<instance_name>/rebuild --data '{"source": {"type":"none"}}'

See [`POST /1.0/instances/{name}/rebuild`](swagger:/instances/instance_rebuild_post) for more information.
```
