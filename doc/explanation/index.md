## Entities in LXD

When working with LXD, you should have a basic understanding of the different entities that are used in LXD.
See the {ref}`howtos` for instructions on how to work with these entities, and the following guides to understand the concepts behind them.

## Access management

In LXD, access to the API is controlled through TLS or OpenID Connect authentication.
When using OpenID Connect, you can grant permissions to access specific entities to different clients.
You can also restrict access to LXD entities by confining them to specific projects.
