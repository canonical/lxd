# About `lxc` `show` and `info`

For the entities managed by LXD, the `lxc` command provides a `list` sub-command, and might provide `show` and `info` sub-commands.
The purpose of the `info` sub-command is to show current state information, and the purpose of the `show` sub-command is to show configuration information and how the entity is used by other entities.

For example, the `lxc network info` command shows IP address and traffic statistics:

    Name: lxdbr0
    MAC address: 00:16:3e:d3:ec:41
    MTU: 1500
    State: up

    Ips:
      inet    192.0.2.1
      inet6   2001:db8:f4a1:53d2::1
      inet6   fe80::216:3eff:fed3:ec41

      Bytes sent: 15.54kB
      Packets received: 1433
      Packets sent: 175

The `lxc network show` command, on the other hand, shows how the network is configured, and which entities are using the network:

    config:
      ipv4.address: 192.0.2.1/24
      ipv4.nat: "true"
      ipv6.address: 2001:db8:f4a1:53d2::1/64
      ipv6.nat: "true"
