# Virtual Machines
## Introduction
Virtual machines are a new instance type supported by LXD alongside containers.

They are implemented through the use of `qemu`.

Please note, currently not all features that are available with containers have been implemented for VMs,
however we continue to strive for feature parity with containers.

## Configuration
See [instance configuration](instances.md) for valid configuration options.
