# Units for storage and network limits

Any value that represents bytes or bits can make use of a number of suffixes to make it easier to understand what a particular limit is.

Both decimal and binary (kibi) units are supported, with the latter mostly making sense for storage limits.

The full list of bit suffixes currently supported is:

- bit (1)
- kbit (1000)
- Mbit (1000^2)
- Gbit (1000^3)
- Tbit (1000^4)
- Pbit (1000^5)
- Ebit (1000^6)
- Kibit (1024)
- Mibit (1024^2)
- Gibit (1024^3)
- Tibit (1024^4)
- Pibit (1024^5)
- Eibit (1024^6)

The full list of byte suffixes currently supported is:

- B or bytes (1)
- kB (1000)
- MB (1000^2)
- GB (1000^3)
- TB (1000^4)
- PB (1000^5)
- EB (1000^6)
- KiB (1024)
- MiB (1024^2)
- GiB (1024^3)
- TiB (1024^4)
- PiB (1024^5)
- EiB (1024^6)
