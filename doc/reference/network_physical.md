# Physical network

<!-- Include start physical intro -->
The `physical` network type connects to an existing physical network, which can be a network interface or a bridge, and serves as an uplink network for OVN.
<!-- Include end physical intro -->

This network type allows to specify presets to use when connecting OVN networks to a parent interface or to allow an instance to use a physical interface as a NIC.
In this case, the instance NICs can simply set the `network`option to the network they connect to without knowing any of the underlying configuration details.

## Configuration options

The following configuration key namespaces are currently supported for the `physical` network type:

 - `bgp` (BGP peer configuration)
 - `dns` (DNS server and resolution configuration)
 - `ipv4` (L3 IPv4 configuration)
 - `ipv6` (L3 IPv6 configuration)
 - `maas` (MAAS network identification)
 - `ovn` (OVN configuration)
 - `user` (free-form key/value for user metadata)

The following configuration options are available for the `physical` network type:
