# Production setup
## Introduction
So you've made it past trying out [LXD live online](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/try-it/),
or on a server scavenged from random parts. You like what you see,
and now you want to try doing some serious work with LXD.

With the vanilla installation of Ubuntu Server 18.04, some modifications
to the server configuration will be needed, to avoid common pitfalls when
using containers that require tens of thousands of file operations.


### Common errors that may be encountered

`Failed to allocate directory watch: Too many open files`

`<Error> <Error>: Too many open files`

`failed to open stream: Too many open files in...`

`neighbour: ndisc_cache: neighbor table overflow!`

### /etc/sysctl.conf

Parameter                           | Value      | Default   | Description
:-----                              | :---       | :---      | :---
fs.inotify.max\_queued\_events      | 1048576    | 16384     | This specifies an upper limit on the number of events that can be queued to the corresponding inotify instance. [1]
fs.inotify.max\_user\_instances     | 1048576    | 128       | This specifies an upper limit on the number of inotify instances that can be created per real user ID. [1]
fs.inotify.max\_user\_watches       | 1048576    | 8192      | This specifies an upper limit on the number of watches that can be created per real user ID. [1]
vm.max\_map\_count                  | 262144     | 65530     | This file contains the maximum number of memory map areas a process may have. Memory map areas are used as a side-effect of calling malloc, directly by mmap and mprotect, and also when loading shared libraries.
kernel.dmesg\_restrict              | 1          | 0         | This denies container access to the messages in the kernel ring buffer. Please note that this also will deny access to non-root users on the host system.
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc\_thresh3  | 8192       | 1024      | This is the maximum number of entries in ARP table (IPv4). You should increase this if you create over 1024 containers. Otherwise, you will get the error `neighbour: ndisc_cache: neighbor table overflow!` when the ARP table gets full and those containers will not be able to get a network configuration. [2]
net.ipv6.neigh.default.gc\_thresh3  | 8192       | 1024      | This is the maximum number of entries in ARP table (IPv6). You should increase this if you plan to create over 1024 containers. Otherwise, you will get the error `neighbour: ndisc_cache: neighbor table overflow!` when the ARP table gets full and those containers will not be able to get a network configuration. [2]
net.core.bpf_jit_limit              | 3000000000 | 264241152 | This is a limit on the size of eBPF JIT allocations which is usually set to PAGE_SIZE * 40000. When your kernel is compiled with `CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON=y` then `/proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable` is set to `1` and can't be changed. On such kernels the eBPF JIT compiler will treat failure to JIT compile a bpf program such as a `seccomp` filter as fatal when it would continue on another kernel. On such kernels the limit for eBPF jitted programs needs to be increased siginficantly.
kernel.keys.maxkeys                 | 2000       | 200       | This is the maximum number of keys a non-root user can use, should be higher than the number of containers
kernel.keys.maxbytes                | 2000000    | 20000     | This is the maximum size of the keyring non-root users can use
fs.aio-max-nr                       | 524288     | 65536     | This is the maximum number of concurrent async I/O operations. You might need to increase it further if you have a lot of workloads that use the AIO subsystem (e.g. MySQL)

Then, reboot the server.

### Network Bandwidth Tweaking 
If you have at least 1GbE NIC on your lxd host with a lot of local
activity (container - container connections, or host - container
connections), or you have 1GbE or better internet connection on your lxd
host it worth play with txqueuelen. These settings work even better with
10GbE NIC.

#### Server Changes
##### txqueuelen 
You need to change `txqueuelen` of your real NIC to 10000 (not sure
about the best possible value for you), and change and change lxdbr0
interface `txqueuelen` to 10000.  

In Debian-based distros you can change `txqueuelen` permanently in `/etc/network/interfaces`  
You can add for ex.: `up ip link set eth0 txqueuelen 10000` to your interface configuration to set txqueuelen value on boot.  
You could set it txqueuelen temporary (for test purpose) with `ifconfig <interface> txqueuelen 10000`

##### /etc/sysctl.conf
You also need to increase `net.core.netdev_max_backlog` value.  
You can add `net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 182757` to `/etc/sysctl.conf` to set it permanently (after reboot)
You set `netdev_max_backlog` temporary (for test purpose) with `echo 182757 > /proc/sys/net/core/netdev_max_backlog`
Note: You can find this value too high, most people prefer set `netdev_max_backlog` = `net.ipv4.tcp_mem` min. value.
For example I use this values `net.ipv4.tcp_mem = 182757 243679 365514`

#### Containers changes
You also need to change txqueuelen value for all you ethernet interfaces in containers.  
In Debian-based distros you can change txqueuelen permanently in `/etc/network/interfaces`  
You can add for ex.: `up ip link set eth0 txqueuelen 10000` to your interface configuration to set txqueuelen value on boot.

#### Notes regarding this change
10000 txqueuelen value commonly used with 10GbE NICs. Basically small
txqueuelen values used with slow devices with a high latency, and higher
with devices with low latency. I personally have like 3-5% improvement
with these settings for local (host with container, container vs
container) and internet connections. Good thing about txqueuelen value
tweak, the more containers you use, the more you can be can benefit from
this tweak. And you can always temporary set this values and check this
tweak in your environment without lxd host reboot.
