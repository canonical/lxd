# How to use `cloud-init`

```{youtube} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OCG15TAldI
```

[`cloud-init`](https://cloud-init.io/) is a tool for automatically initializing and customizing an instance of a Linux distribution.

By adding `cloud-init` configuration to your instance, you can instruct `cloud-init` to execute specific actions at the first start of an instance.
Possible actions include, for example:

* Updating and installing packages
* Applying certain configurations
* Adding users
* Enabling services
* Running commands or scripts
* Automatically growing the file system of a VM to the size of the disk

See the {ref}`cloud-init:index` for detailed information.

```{note}
The `cloud-init` actions are run only once on the first start of the instance.
Rebooting the instance does not re-trigger the actions.
```

## `cloud-init` support in images

To use `cloud-init`, you must base your instance on an image that has `cloud-init` installed:

* All images from the `ubuntu` and `ubuntu-daily` {ref}`image servers <remote-image-servers>` have `cloud-init` support.
* Images from the [`images` remote](https://images.linuxcontainers.org/) have `cloud-init`-enabled variants, which are usually bigger in size than the default variant.
  The cloud variants use the `/cloud` suffix, for example, `images:ubuntu/22.04/cloud`.

## Configuration options

LXD supports two different sets of configuration options for configuring `cloud-init`: `cloud-init.*` and `user.*`.
Which of these sets you must use depends on the `cloud-init` support in the image that you use.
As a rule of thumb, newer images support the `cloud-init.*` configuration options, while older images support `user.*`.
However, there might be exceptions to that rule.

The following configuration options are supported:

* `cloud-init.vendor-data` or `user.vendor-data` (see {ref}`cloud-init:vendordata`)
* `cloud-init.user-data` or `user.user-data` (see {ref}`cloud-init:user_data_formats`)
* `cloud-init.network-config` or `user.network-config` (see {ref}`cloud-init:network_config`)

For more information about the configuration options, see the [`cloud-init` instance options](instance-options-cloud-init), and the documentation for the {ref}`LXD data source <cloud-init:datasource_lxd>` in the `cloud-init` documentation.

### Vendor data and user data

Both `vendor-data` and `user-data` are used to provide {ref}`cloud configuration data <explanation/format:cloud config data>` to `cloud-init`.

The main idea is that `vendor-data` is used for the general default configuration, while `user-data` is used for instance-specific configuration.
This means that you should specify `vendor-data` in a profile and `user-data` in the instance configuration.
LXD does not enforce this method, but allows using both `vendor-data` and `user-data` in profiles and in the instance configuration.

If both `vendor-data` and `user-data` are supplied for an instance, `cloud-init` merges the two configurations.
However, if you use the same keys in both configurations, merging might not be possible.
In this case, configure how `cloud-init` should merge the provided data.
See {ref}`cloud-init:merging_user_data` for instructions.

## How to configure `cloud-init`

To configure `cloud-init` for an instance, add the corresponding configuration options to a {ref}`profile <profiles>` that the instance uses or directly to the {ref}`instance configuration <instances-configure>`.

When configuring `cloud-init` directly for an instance, keep in mind that `cloud-init` runs only on the first start of the instance.
That means that you must configure `cloud-init` before you start the instance.
To do so, create the instance with `lxc init` instead of `lxc launch`, and then start it after completing the configuration.

### YAML format for `cloud-init` configuration

The `cloud-init` options require YAML's [literal style format](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#812-literal-style).
You use a pipe symbol (`|`) to indicate that all indented text after the pipe should be passed to `cloud-init` as a single string, with new lines and indentation preserved.

The `vendor-data` and `user-data` options usually start with `#cloud-config`.

For example:

```yaml
config:
  cloud-init.user-data: |
    #cloud-config
    package_upgrade: true
    packages:
      - package1
      - package2
```

```{tip}
See {ref}`cloud-init:reference/faq:how can i debug my user data?` for information on how to check whether the syntax is correct.
```

## How to check the `cloud-init` status

`cloud-init` runs automatically on the first start of an instance.
Depending on the configured actions, it might take a while until it finishes.

To check the `cloud-init` status, log on to the instance and enter the following command:

    cloud-init status

If the result is `status: running`, `cloud-init` is still working. If the result is `status: done`, it has finished.

Alternatively, use the `--wait` flag to be notified only when `cloud-init` is finished:

```{terminal}
:input: cloud-init status --wait
:user: root
:host: instance

.....................................
status: done
```

## How to specify user or vendor data

The `user-data` and `vendor-data` configuration can be used to, for example, upgrade or install packages, add users, or run commands.

The provided values must have a first line that indicates what type of {ref}`user data format <cloud-init:user_data_formats>` is being passed to `cloud-init`.
For activities like upgrading packages or setting up a user, `#cloud-config` is the data format to use.

The configuration data is stored in the following files in the instance's root file system:

* `/var/lib/cloud/instance/cloud-config.txt`
* `/var/lib/cloud/instance/user-data.txt`

### Examples

See the following sections for the user data (or vendor data) configuration for different example use cases.

You can find more advanced {ref}`examples <cloud-init:yaml_examples>` in the `cloud-init` documentation.

#### Upgrade packages

To trigger a package upgrade from the repositories for the instance right after the instance is created, use the `package_upgrade` key:

```yaml
config:
  cloud-init.user-data: |
    #cloud-config
    package_upgrade: true
```

#### Install packages

To install specific packages when the instance is set up, use the `packages` key and specify the package names as a list:

```yaml
config:
  cloud-init.user-data: |
    #cloud-config
    packages:
      - git
      - openssh-server
```

#### Set the time zone

To set the time zone for the instance on instance creation, use the `timezone` key:

```yaml
config:
  cloud-init.user-data: |
    #cloud-config
    timezone: Europe/Rome
```

#### Run commands

To run a command (such as writing a marker file), use the `runcmd` key and specify the commands as a list:

```yaml
config:
  cloud-init.user-data: |
    #cloud-config
    runcmd:
      - [touch, /run/cloud.init.ran]
```

#### Add a user account

To add a user account, use the `user` key.
See the {ref}`cloud-init:reference/examples:including users and groups` example in the `cloud-init` documentation for details about default users and which keys are supported.

```yaml
config:
  cloud-init.user-data: |
    #cloud-config
    user:
      - name: documentation_example
```

## How to specify network configuration data

By default, `cloud-init` configures a DHCP client on an instance's `eth0` interface.
You can define your own network configuration using the `network-config` option to override the default configuration (this is due to how the template is structured).

`cloud-init` then renders the relevant network configuration on the system using either `ifupdown` or `netplan`, depending on the Ubuntu release.

The configuration data is stored in the following files in the instance's root file system:

* `/var/lib/cloud/seed/nocloud-net/network-config`
* `/etc/network/interfaces.d/50-cloud-init.cfg` (if using `ifupdown`)
* `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` (if using `netplan`)

### Example

To configure a specific network interface with a static IPv4 address and also use a custom name server, use the following configuration:

```yaml
config:
  cloud-init.network-config: |
    version: 1
    config:
      - type: physical
        name: eth1
        subnets:
          - type: static
            ipv4: true
            address: 10.10.101.20
            netmask: 255.255.255.0
            gateway: 10.10.101.1
            control: auto
      - type: nameserver
        address: 10.10.10.254
```
